# VideoSpeedController
A Firefox browser extension that provides a toolbar menu for HTML 5 video speed manipulation. It is capable of setting speeds that are typically unavailable from the video menu and it also requires fewer clicks to change the speed.

## Installation

To install the plugin in Firefox, do one of the following:

1. Download the code and temporarily load the plugin in Firefox via about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox. This will work for the current session only.
2. Open the xpi file distribured in the 'Releases' section 
3. Create and open your own self distributed xpi file via Firefox's Add-on Developer Hub.

## Usage
Once installed, a new icon will appear in Firefox's toolbar. Clicking this icon will open a popup that allows you to choose the speed for all HTML 5 videos on the current tab. The speed options are 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, and 4.
