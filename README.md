# VideoSpeedController
A Firefox browser extension that provides a toolbar menu and keyboard shortcuts for HTML 5 video speed manipulation. It is capable of setting speeds beyond those available from the video menu and it also makes changing speeds much faster.

## Installation

To install, either temporarily load the plugin in Firefox via about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, or create your own self distributed xpi file via Firefox's Add-on Developer Hub.

## Usage
Once installed, a new icon will appear in Firefox's toolbar. Clicking this icon will open a popup that allows you to increment/decrement/set speed for all HTML 5 videos on the current tab. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to increment and decrement the speed.

## Keyboard shortcuts

* Decrement speed by 0.25: Ctrl+Alt+Z
* Return to normal speed: Ctrl+Alt+X
* Increment speed by 0.25: Ctrl+Alt+C
