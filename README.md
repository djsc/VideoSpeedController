# VideoSpeedController
A Firefox browser extension that provides a toolbar menu for HTML 5 video speed manipulation. It is capable of setting speeds that are typically unavailable from the video menu and it also requires fewer clicks to change the speed.

## Installation

To install, either temporarily load the plugin in Firefox via about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox, or create your own self distributed xpi file via Firefox's Add-on Developer Hub.

## Usage
Once installed, a new icon will appear in Firefox's toolbar. Clicking this icon will open a popup that allows you to choose the speed for all HTML 5 videos on the current tab. The speed options are [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4].
